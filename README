Important information:
1. We added at least 2 test to RecordQUnit.cc to handle things like writing to files. 
As I wasn't sure how to test it in terms of the result variable, you can check emptyFile.tbl 
in Build after running our test case 11 for the result.
2. In some files, we weren't meant to edit have slight line count differences, it's because 
we added and removed a few debug cout statements. Apart from that, they should be the same.
